```
Moltzer is a lightning-fast, native desktop client for AI chat. Connect to your personal AI gateway and chat with Claude, GPT, Gemini, and other models — all in one beautiful, distraction-free interface.

BLAZING FAST PERFORMANCE
• 10MB binary — not 300MB like Electron apps
• ~50MB RAM usage vs 500MB for browser-based alternatives  
• Native macOS experience with full keyboard navigation
• Streaming responses appear in real-time

BEAUTIFUL, FOCUSED DESIGN
• Clean, minimalist interface that gets out of your way
• Dark mode, light mode, or follow your system preference
• Rich markdown with syntax-highlighted code blocks
• GitHub-flavored markdown: tables, task lists, strikethrough

PRIVATE & SECURE
• End-to-end encryption — all conversations encrypted at rest with AES-256
• Credentials stored in macOS Keychain — never in plain text
• Zero cloud storage — your data stays on YOUR device
• Open source: audit the code yourself

POWERFUL ORGANIZATION
• Unlimited chat history with instant full-text search
• Pin important conversations to the top
• Auto-generated titles from your first message
• Find any past conversation in milliseconds

MULTI-MODEL FREEDOM
• Connect to Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, and more
• Switch models on the fly — use the best AI for each task
• Thinking mode for extended reasoning on complex problems
• Works with any OpenAI-compatible API endpoint

KEYBOARD-FIRST WORKFLOW
• ?N — New conversation

WHY Moltzer?
We built Moltzer because we were tired of sluggish Electron apps eating 500MB of RAM for a text box. Moltzer is built with Tauri v2 and Rust — the same technology behind secure, high-performance native apps. It's what ChatGPT's desktop app should have been.

REQUIREMENTS
• Requires connection to a Clawdbot Gateway or compatible AI endpoint
• macOS 11 (Big Sur) or later
• Internet connection required for AI inference

### 1.2 Keywords (100 characters max)

```
AI,ChatGPT,Claude,chat,assistant,GPT,Gemini,LLM,coding,productivity,Anthropic,OpenAI,conversation
```

**Keyword Strategy:**
- Lead with high-volume terms: AI, ChatGPT, Claude
- Include competitor/model names: GPT, Gemini, Anthropic, OpenAI
- Add use-case terms: chat, assistant, coding, productivity
- Avoid wasting characters on "app" (automatic)

   - `Moltzer-1.0.0.AppImage`
   - Include SHA256 checksum file

3. **Add to AppImageHub** (optional):
   - Submit to [AppImageHub.com](https://appimage.github.io/apps/)
   - Create `Moltzer.yml` in [AppImage/appimage.github.io](https://github.com/AppImage/appimage.github.io)

4. **AppImage desktop integration:**
   - Users run: `chmod +x Moltzer-*.AppImage && ./Moltzer-*.AppImage`
   - Recommend [AppImageLauncher](https://github.com/TheAssassin/AppImageLauncher) for menu integration

---

## 4. Screenshots Strategy

### 4.1 The 5-Screenshot Story

Each screenshot should tell a part of Moltzer's story. Order matters!

| # | Screen | Purpose | Key Elements |
|---|--------|---------|--------------|
| 1 | **Hero Shot** | First impression, show the product | Main chat view with compelling conversation, beautiful code rendering |
| 2 | **Feature: Multi-Model** | Differentiation | Model picker dropdown visible, maybe comparison |
| 3 | **Feature: Search** | Organization power | Search modal open, results highlighted |
| 4 | **Feature: Dark Mode** | Visual appeal | Same view as #1 but in dark mode |
| 5 | **Feature: Code** | Developer appeal | Long code block with syntax highlighting, copy button visible |

### 4.2 Screenshot Specifications

| Platform | Resolution | Format |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| macOS App Store | 2880×1800 (Retina) | PNG |
| macOS App Store | 1600×1000 (non-Retina) | PNG |
| Microsoft Store | 2560×1600 (recommended) | PNG/JPEG |
| Flathub/Snap | 1920×1080 (16:9) | PNG |

---

### 4.3 Dark Mode vs Light Mode

**Recommendation:** Lead with Dark Mode

**Why:**
- More visually striking in store listings
- Differentiates from competitors (most show light mode)
- Developers prefer dark mode (power user signal)
- Makes code blocks pop

**Strategy:**
- Screenshot #1: Dark mode (hero)
- Screenshot #4: Light mode (show we support it)
- All others: Dark mode

---

### 4.4 What to Show in Each Screenshot

#### Screenshot 1: Hero Shot (Dark Mode)
**Elements:**
- Full app window (sidebar + chat)
- Active conversation with 3-4 messages
- AI response includes code block with syntax highlighting
- Model indicator visible (Claude Sonnet 4.5)
- Clean, professional appearance

**Conversation Example:**
```
User: How do I create a React hook for fetching data?

Claude: Here's a custom hook for data fetching with loading and error states:

[Code block with useDataFetch hook]

You can use it like this:

[Usage example]
```

---

#### Screenshot 2: Multi-Model Selection
**Elements:**
- Model picker dropdown OPEN
- Show 4-5 models visible (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini)
- Highlight current selection
- Sidebar visible with conversations

**Caption:** "Choose the best AI for each task"

---

#### Screenshot 3: Search
**Elements:**
- Search modal (?K) open and centered
- Search query visible: "python"
- 3-4 search results with highlighted matches
- Each result shows conversation title + preview

**Caption:** "Find any message in milliseconds"

---

#### Screenshot 4: Light Mode
**Elements:**
- Same layout as Screenshot 1
- Light theme
- Different conversation (variety)
- Settings panel partially visible (show theme picker)

**Caption:** "Light mode, dark mode, or follow your system"

---

#### Screenshot 5: Code & Markdown
**Elements:**
- Long, beautiful code block (Python or TypeScript)
- Copy button visible (hovering)
- Line numbers (if implemented)
- Below code: markdown table or task list
- Show the richness of markdown rendering

**Caption:** "Code highlighting for 50+ languages"

---

### 4.5 Screenshot Capture Process

```bash
# macOS: Use Screenshot.app or
? + Shift + 4, then Space to capture window

# Ensure:
# - Window is at correct resolution
# - Hide any personal data
# - Use consistent dummy data
# - Capture with shadow (macOS) or without (Windows)
```

**Dummy Data Guidelines:**
- Use generic prompts (no company info)
- No real names or emails visible
- Code examples should be educational
- Gateway URL: `ws://localhost:18789` (acceptable)

---

**Don't:**
- Show real personal data
- Include cursor movements that are too fast
- Use jarring transitions
- Add excessive text overlays
- Make it longer than necessary

**Tools:**
- macOS: ScreenFlow, Final Cut Pro
- Windows: Camtasia, OBS Studio
