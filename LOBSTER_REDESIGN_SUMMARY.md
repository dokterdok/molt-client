# Lobster Redesign: Abstract → Realistic

## David's Feedback
> **"The icon needs to look like a real lobster"** — closer to 🦞 emoji or Clawdbot logo style, NOT the abstract shrimp/creature.

## Changes Made

### Before (Abstract Creature)
The original design was a simplified, cute character that didn't clearly read as a lobster:
- Small simple claws
- Short antennae  
- Blob-like body
- More shrimp-like than lobster

### After (Realistic Lobster 🦞)
Redesigned to match actual lobster anatomy:

#### ✅ **Large Claws**
- Left: Crusher claw (larger, rounder)
- Right: Pincer claw (slightly smaller, more pointed)
- Proper arm segments connecting to body
- Pincer details on each claw

#### ✅ **Long Antennae**
- Extend from head all the way to top edge
- Characteristic of real lobsters
- With rounded tips

#### ✅ **Eye Stalks**
- Eyes on raised stalks (not flush with body)
- Black eyes with white highlights
- Proper lobster eye anatomy

#### ✅ **Walking Legs**
- Four pairs (8 legs total)
- Decreasing size from front to back
- Proper joint articulation
- Extended outward naturally

#### ✅ **Segmented Abdomen**
- 5 clearly defined segments
- Horizontal dividing lines
- Tapered toward tail
- Classic lobster body segmentation

#### ✅ **Tail Fan**
- Center telson (middle tail piece)
- Two pairs of uropods (side flaps)
- Proper fan arrangement
- Subtle vein details

## Result
The icon now **immediately reads as a lobster** 🦞 rather than an abstract crustacean. It matches:
- The Apple lobster emoji style
- Clawdbot logo anatomy
- Real lobster silhouette
- Professional icon design standards

## Technical Details
