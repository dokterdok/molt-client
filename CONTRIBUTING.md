## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
- **Rust** (latest stable version)
- **npm** or **yarn**
- **Tauri CLI** (installed automatically via npm)

### Setting Up Development Environment

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dokterdok/moltzer-client.git
   cd moltzer-client
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run in development mode:**
   ```bash
   npm run tauri dev
   ```

The app will open with hot-reload enabled. Changes to the frontend will automatically refresh, and Rust changes will trigger a rebuild.

## 💻 Development Workflow

### Branch Naming

- `feature/description` - New features
- `bugfix/description` - Bug fixes
- `docs/description` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/description` - Code refactoring

### Commit Messages

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

- `feat: add voice input support`
- `fix: resolve encryption key rotation issue`
- `docs: update installation guide`
- `refactor: simplify WebSocket connection logic`
- `test: add E2E tests for conversation deletion`
- `chore: update dependencies`

### Code Style

**TypeScript/React:**
- **Type safety:** Use TypeScript for all new code, avoid `any` types
- **Linting:** Follow ESLint rules (`npm run lint`) — PRs must pass with no errors
- **Formatting:** Run Prettier (`npm run format`) before committing
- **Components:** Prefer functional components with hooks over class components
- **State management:** Use Zustand for global state, React hooks for local state
- **Naming conventions:**
  - Components: PascalCase (`MessageBubble.tsx`)
  - Functions: camelCase (`sendMessage()`)
  - Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (`MAX_MESSAGE_LENGTH`)
  - Interfaces: PascalCase with `I` prefix optional (`Message` or `IMessage`)
- **File organization:**
  - One component per file
  - Group related utilities in `lib/`
  - Colocate tests with source files (`*.test.ts`)
- **Comments:** Add JSDoc comments for exported functions and complex logic
- **Imports:** Group and order: React → external libs → internal modules → styles

**Example:**
```typescript
/**
 * Send a message to the Gateway
 * @param content - Message text
 * @param conversationId - Target conversation
 * @returns Promise resolving when message is sent
 */
export async function sendMessage(
  content: string,
  conversationId: string
): Promise<void> {
  // Implementation
}
```

**Rust:**
- **Formatting:** Run `cargo fmt` before committing
- **Linting:** Run `cargo clippy` and fix all warnings
- **Documentation:** Add doc comments (`///`) for all public functions and structs
- **Error handling:** Use `Result<T, E>` and avoid panics in library code
- **Naming:** Follow Rust conventions (snake_case for functions, PascalCase for types)

**Example:**
```rust
/// Connect to the Clawdbot Gateway
///
/// # Arguments
/// * `url` - WebSocket URL (ws:// or wss://)
/// * `token` - Optional authentication token
///
/// # Returns
/// Connection handle or error
pub async fn connect_gateway(
    url: &str,
    token: Option<&str>
) -> Result<GatewayConnection, GatewayError> {
    // Implementation
}
```

### Testing

**All PRs must include tests.** Code without tests will not be merged unless there's a compelling reason.

**Run tests:**
```bash
# Unit tests (vitest)
npm run test

# Unit tests with UI
npm run test:ui

# E2E tests (Playwright)
npm run test:e2e

# E2E tests with UI
npm run test:e2e:ui

# E2E tests in debug mode
npm run test:e2e:debug

# Run specific test file
npm run test -- db.test.ts
```

**Test requirements:**
- **Unit tests:** For all utility functions, hooks, and business logic
  - Test happy paths and edge cases
  - Mock external dependencies (Gateway, IndexedDB, etc.)
  - Aim for >80% code coverage
  
- **Integration tests:** For components that interact with stores or DB
  - Test user interactions (clicks, typing, etc.)
  - Verify state updates correctly
  - Use `@testing-library/react` for component tests
  
- **E2E tests:** For critical user flows
  - Onboarding and setup
  - Sending and receiving messages
  - Conversation management (create, delete, search)
  - Settings changes
  
**Writing good tests:**
```typescript
// ✅ Good: Descriptive test names
test('should encrypt message content before saving to DB', async () => {
  // Arrange
  const message = 'Hello, world!';
  const key = await generateEncryptionKey();
  
  // Act
  const encrypted = await encryptMessage(message, key);
  
  // Assert
  expect(encrypted).not.toBe(message);
  expect(await decryptMessage(encrypted, key)).toBe(message);
});

// ❌ Bad: Vague test name
test('encryption works', async () => {
  // ...
});
```

**Test file organization:**
- Colocate tests with source: `db.ts` → `db.test.ts`
- E2E tests go in `e2e/` folder
- Shared test utilities in `src/test/` and `e2e/helpers/`

**Coverage requirements:**
- New features: Must have >80% coverage
- Bug fixes: Must include regression test
- Refactoring: Maintain or improve existing coverage

### Building

**Development build:**
```bash
npm run tauri dev
```

**Production build:**
```bash
npm run tauri build
```

Builds will be output to `src-tauri/target/release/`.
