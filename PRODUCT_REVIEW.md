## 5. Ship Blockers

### High Priority (Should Fix Before Launch)
None identified.

### Medium Priority (Can Fix Post-Launch)
1. **Bundle size**: 340KB for markdown renderer (gzip: 103KB) - could lazy load
2. **Error boundary UX**: Could add "Report Bug" button
3. **Accessibility**: Some aria-labels could be more descriptive

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)
1. Add keyboard shortcut help modal (⌘?)
2. Add conversation folders/tags
3. Add voice input support
