### Active Agents
None currently running - all completed or aborted.

### Priority Gap Analysis
| Priority | Area | Status |
|----------|------|--------|
| P0 | Memory | ✅ Fixed (react-leaks, memory-hunter) |
| P0 | Performance | ⚠️ Partial (memory fixes help, more possible) |
| P0 | Connection | ❌ Not addressed |
| P1 | Search | ✅ Done (search-ux) |
| P1 | Onboarding | ⚠️ Plan created, needs live testing |
| P1 | Streaming | ❌ Aborted (streaming-ux) |
| P2 | Activity | ❌ Not addressed |
| P2 | Version | ❌ Not addressed |

### Spawning Decision
**Rationale:** P0 connection resilience is critical for production stability. P1 streaming-ux directly impacts user experience during every interaction.

**Spawned:**
1. `moltz-connection-resilience` ✅ - P0 priority, handle reconnects gracefully
2. `moltz-streaming-polish` ✅ - P1, smooth streaming without jank
